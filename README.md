# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate Pyber ride sharing data and create dataframes to see show the breakdown of business by location type, amount of drivers, and the associated costs. This analysis also created a visualization that shows how the total fares by city type compare over a period of time. 

## Results
The results of this analysis showed that rural areas had the lowest amount of total rides with the least amount of drivers, but they did have the highest average fair per driver with an average rate of $55.49. This higher average however, was not enough to offset the total fares income provided by the other two city types that had much higher total riders and drivers. Urban areas were the most popular places for rides and drivers, and although the average fare was only $16.57, the total fares from urban areas accounted for 62.7% of all income.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, it is recommended to see if increasing the amount of drivers in the rural city types could lower the fares and encourage more trips to be taken, thus increasing overall income. Additionally, collecting more data to see information such as the average ride length for each city type, the average wait time for riders, and the average amount of rides for drivers could provide more direction for driving business change. This information could provide insights on the demand for rides as well as the suitability of the number of current total drivers for the location.
